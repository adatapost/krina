The Java Platform
==================

What do you meant by the term "Platform"?
 
   A "Platform" is a computing environment that is used to develop, deploy and
   execute the applications in distributed environment.

   Basically, the Operating System is our first programming platform. To code in OS,
   we need to use C or C++ programming languages and libraries. Due to lack of know-
   how of C/C++, we can't develop apps on OS platform directly. Instead, we will 
   use "high-level platforms like - Java, DOTNET, etc" that will install upon the
   OS and provide OS services to us.

    Java Language Or Scala Language or Kotlin language etc.

     OS Platform

There are four sub platforms of Java
  1. Java SE - Standard Edition 
  2. Java ME - Micro Edition
  3. Java Fx - Graphics  (Fix)
  4. Java EE - Enterprise Edition

Each sub Platform has :
    1. Application Programming Interface (API) or Library (Class library)
    2. Runtime (Java Runtime Environment)

 1. API - It is a huge "TYPE Library" and it include almost all purpose TYPES ranging
    from String handling to Graphical User Interface and Database.
    Note: There are approx 2500 TYPES in Java SE. (ME, Fx and EE have different
    purpose classes/types).

 2. Java Runtime Environment (JRE) - It is rich runtime environment that prepares 
    a "program - Java .class file" for the execution (OS can execute).

    Note that the JRE cannot execute program but it prepares your program so the 
    OS will execute the instructions of your program.

When you install Java Developer Kit (JDK), Java SE platform will be installed along with "Java" compiler. Current JDK version is 10 - Java 10 or JavaSE 10 and also Java language's specification is 10.

What is "GIT"?

  It is a source code control protocol. People uses this "protocol" to implement the source code   control tools. 

  This protocol (GIT) is proposed and developed by the creator of the LINUS OS - Mr. Linus   Torvald.

Download the GIT tool for your OS (x86 or 64):

 Visit   https://git-scm.com/download link to download the GIT tool.

 This tool is used to "manage" local repositories -- a repository is a "file system" folder which keeps different version/edition of source code or documents in the form of "nodes". Each node is a "Hash" of changed document.

 You can use the "Remote" repositories to share the "documents and project source code". There are number of 'remote repositories' -- bitbucket, github etc. We will use "github" remote repository to synchronize our local repositories to remote repositories.


Step-1 Install the git-scm tool (First time or once)

Step-2 Open the command prompt and type "git" command to test whether your system have "git" installed or not. The "git" command will displays help text at command prompt if it is installed.

Step-3  Now, create your own repository at local machine.

  1. Assume that your c:\yash> is folder that you wish to define as "repository"
  2. Issue "git init" command at c:\yash>git init
  3. c:\yash>notepad sample.txt   <--- Create a text document and add some text in it + save it
     Now, add sample.txt document into to git repo
  4. c:\yash>git add sample.txt   Or use git add *.* to add all files
  5. c:\yash>git commit -m "added sample document"
  
Repeat step-3 to 5 for any changes (updatation of file content or creation or deletion of dirs)

  6. If you wish to synchronize local repository then create the user account at "github.com" and 
     perform following steps:
        1. Create "new" + icon repository.
        2. Use "unique" name.
        3. CLick on Create Repository
        4. Now, attach local repository to remote,
 
            c:\yash>git remote add origin https://github.com/adatapost/krina.git
            c:\yash>git push -u origin master
